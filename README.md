# Smark
## This is something that won't turn into much, and is mainly to help me enhance skills with improving my golang skills.

### Smark?
I just got it off some random name generator because I can't think of these things myself.

### What is it?
As of 16/08/2018, it is a functional login, logout system and a main page which is only accessable to those logged in with language support from 24/08.
As to what it will turn into, I couldn't say.
