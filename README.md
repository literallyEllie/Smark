## This is something that won't turn into much, and is mainly to help me enhance skills with improving my golang skills.

### Smark?
I just got it off some random name generator because I can't think of these things myself.

### What is it?
As of 16/08/2018, it is a functional login, logout system and a main page which is only accessable to those logged in.
As to what it will turn into, I couldn't say.

### Pictures: 

Login page: [Login page](https://i.imgur.com/Ri3Y0MB.jpg) *It is centered I swear*

Users only: [Users only page](https://i.imgur.com/64Lrdeu.jpg)

## It is currently riddled with debug messages and flaws but I will get to it
Bye!!
